This is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game built with Python 🐍, where you can play against the computer 🤖. The game allows you to choose one of three moves—**rock** 🪨, **paper** 📄, or **scissors** ✂️—and then the computer randomly selects its own move. The outcome of the game is determined by the classic rules:

- **Rock** ⛰️ crushes **Scissors** ✂️
- **Scissors** ✂️ cuts **Paper** 📄
- **Paper** 📄 covers **Rock** ⛰️

The [**program**](https://github.com/Nevtimova/Small-Projects/blob/main/Rock_paper_scissors/rock_paper_scissors.py) keeps track of the scores 📊 and displays them after each round. It also allows the player to decide whether they want to play again 🔄 after each round. Invalid inputs are handled gracefully ⚠️, and the game ends when the user decides not to continue 🚪.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The main goals of this **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game are:

- 🧑‍💻 **To create a simple, interactive game** where users can play against the computer.
- 🤖 **To implement basic randomization** for the computer's moves.
- 📊 **To track and display the player's and computer's scores** after each round.
- 🔄 **To allow the user to play multiple rounds** and decide whether to continue.
- ⚙️ **To handle invalid inputs gracefully** and ensure smooth gameplay.
- 🏆 **To practice and reinforce Python programming concepts** such as conditionals, loops, functions, and random number generation.

These goals help create an engaging and educational experience for users, while demonstrating fundamental programming techniques.
