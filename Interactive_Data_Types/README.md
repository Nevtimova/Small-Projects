# Interactive Data Type Operations System

  This Python project demonstrates basic operations on common data types: Strings, Numbers, Booleans, and Additional Data Types (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries). It provides an interactive menu that allows users to perform different operations on each data type, such as string manipulation, arithmetic, logical operations, and handling lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

### 🌟 Project Overview 
I will write a Python program that:

Prompts the user to select a data type from a list of choices.
Based on the user’s selection, performs specific operations related to that data type.
Provides meaningful output and handles edge cases (like dividing by zero or modifying an immutable type).

## 🔧Key Features:


***Strings*** ✂️: Extract substrings, convert to uppercase, and replace words 🔄.

***Numbers*** ➗: Perform basic arithmetic operations ➕ ➖ ✖️ ➗ and exponentiation ⚡.

***Booleans*** 🔐: Use logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) 🤔 and comparisons 🧐.

***Additional Data Types*** 🗂️: Work with Lists 📜, Tuples (immutable) 🔒, and Dictionaries 📚.

### [This](https://github.com/Nevtimova/Small-Projects/blob/main/Interactive_Data_Types/interactive_data_type_operations_system.py) project helps beginners understand Python data types and their operations interactively.
